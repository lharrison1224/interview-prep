# Interview Preparation

This repository contains Python3 implementations of standard technical interview material as outlined by Google.

## Sorting

- Details of at least one or two O(nlogn) sorting algorithms
- Common sorting functions and their differences/when to use one over another
- Know runtime and space efficiencies

## Hash Tables and Maps

- "Hashtables are arguably the single most important data structure known to mankind."
- Implement them only using arrays
- Know runtimes and efficiencies of standard library hashes and maps

## Trees

- Construction, traversal, manipulation
- Binary trees, n-ary trees, trie-ary trees
- At least one flavor of balanced binary trees (red/black, splay, AVL)
- Traversal as DFS/BFS
- Difference between inorder, postorder, preorder

## Heaps

- Understand their applications
- Know their big-oh efficiencies
- Know when it makes sense to use one

## Graphs

- "Graphs are good abstractions to apply because algorithms for distance, search, connectivity, and cycle-detection are well known."
- Three ways to represent graphs in memory: objects and pointers, matrix, adjacency list. Know each and its pros/cons
- BFS/DFS and their computational complexity, tradeoffs, and implementations

## Recursion

- Prepare for recursion
- Know how to transform iterative solution to recursion

## Operating Systems

- Processes, threads, concurrency issues, locks, mutexes, semaphores, monitors
- Deadlock, livelock, and avoidance
- Resource needs of processes and threads
- Context switching and how its implemented
- Scheduling
- Fundementals of "modern, multi-core systems"

## Mathematics

- Basic discrete math
- Elementary probability theory
- Combinatorics
- n-choose-k problems

## Other

- Know famous cases of NP-complete: traveling salesperson and knapsack
- Be able to recognize these problems in disguise
- Meaning of NP-complete
